# 🛰️ OSI Model – Study Notes

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a 7-layer framework that standardizes how data moves across networks.

1. **Physical Layer** – Cables, signals, hardware  
2. **Data Link Layer** – MAC addresses, switches, Ethernet  
3. **Network Layer** – IP addressing, routing  
4. **Transport Layer** – TCP/UDP, reliability  
5. **Session Layer** – Connections, session management  
6. **Presentation Layer** – Data format, encryption  
7. **Application Layer** – HTTP, DNS, user apps

✅ Example:
- Sending an email (Application Layer)  
- Data formatted (Presentation Layer)  
- Session created (Session Layer)  
- Data chopped into segments (Transport Layer)  
- Addressed with IP (Network Layer)  
- Sent over Ethernet (Data Link)  
- Transmitted as signals (Physical)
